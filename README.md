## Questions Explored
The project explores a variety of questions related to the life and experiences of immigrants in Canada, such as:

- How are immigrants distributed across Canadian provinces and CMAs?
- What are the prevalent mother tongues among immigrants?
- How do educational credentials and labor force participation vary among immigrants in different provinces?
- What is the average property price and family income for immigrants from various admission categories?
- How do social factors affect the well-being of immigrants in different regions?


## Data Sources
In our comprehensive analysis, we examined datasets encompassing a wide range of factors impacting immigrants in Canada, including census data, labor force participation, education and  employment status, property ownership, and social challenges faced by these individuals.
We were able to acquire significant insights by utilizing data at the provincial and CMA (Census Metropolitan Area) levels. All of our datasets were collected from Statistics Canada portal (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data). Most of these datasets are part of 2021 census conducted by Canadian Government.

To explore and understand the overall immigration patterns in Canada, focusing on the country of birth and mother tongue of immigrants, we have utilized the following datasets:
1. Immigrant status and period of immigration by place of birth and citizenship: Canada, provinces and territories and census metropolitan areas with parts

To analyze the relationship between visible minority status, immigrant background, and key socio-economic factors such as labor force participation, level of education, age, and gender across Canada, we have utilized the following dataset:
