# Understanding the Immigrant experience in Canada

## Overview
Immigration is a dynamic process that requires regular monitoring and analysis to help make informed decisions that support Canadaâ€™s social and economic development. The main objective of this project is to provide valuable insights and information to prospective immigrants who are considering settling in Canada. By analyzing various aspects of life in different regions, including urban centers and surrounding communities, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of what each region has to offer. This analysis can help prospective immigrants make informed decisions about where to settle in Canada based on their individual needs and preferences. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the successful integration and well-being of immigrants in Canada by providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about their future.

## Introduction
This project aims to equip prospective immigrants with the necessary information to make informed decisions about where to settle in Canada. With a comprehensive understanding of life in various regions, including urban centers and surrounding communities, we can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that exist in different Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) and provinces. CMAs are often the preferred destination for new immigrants, offering job opportunities, social networks, and resources that can aid in adjusting to life in a new country.

Our target audience is primarily immigrants who are looking to make well-informed decisions about where to settle in Canada based on their individual needs and preferences. Throughout the project, we have utilized Tableau as our primary data visualization tool. By leveraging Tableau's powerful data visualization features, we have created visually stunning dashboards that effectively communicate our findings, making it easier for prospective immigrants to navigate the decision-making process.

## Questions we intend to answer
Visualizing data effectively and expressively through appropriate channels and marks can convey important insights that text alone cannot achieve. By utilizing effective visualizations and adhering to the principles of expressiveness, we aimed to create dashboards that provides valuable insights into the Canadian immigration process. Our goal was to use appropriate channels and marks to highlight key trends and patterns in the data, enabling us to answer important questions related to the challenges and opportunities faced by immigrants in Canada.
The questions were as follows:
- What is the geographic distribution of immigrants in Canada based on their mother tongue and country of birth, and how does it vary by region (CMAs)?
- What is the trend of the immigrant education level with respect to the employment rate ?
- Is housing affordable for the immigrants ?
- What are the social obstacles that immigrants encounter in their integration into Canadian society?

## Data Sources
In our comprehensive analysis, we examined datasets encompassing a wide range of factors impacting immigrants in Canada, including census data, labor force participation, education and  employment status, property ownership, and social challenges faced by these individuals.
We were able to acquire significant insights by utilizing data at the provincial and CMA (Census Metropolitan Area) levels. All of our datasets were collected from Statistics Canada portal (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data). Most of these datasets are part of 2021 census conducted by Canadian Government.

To explore and understand the overall immigration patterns in Canada, focusing on the country of birth and mother tongue of immigrants, we have utilized the following datasets:
Immigrant status and period of immigration by place of birth and citizenship: Canada, provinces and territories and census metropolitan areas with parts

To analyze the relationship between visible minority status, immigrant background, and key socio-economic factors such as labor force participation, level of education, age, and gender across Canada, we have utilized the following dataset:

To examine the patterns of residential property ownership among immigrants in Canada and understand the differences in property ownership based on immigration characteristics, we have utilized the following dataset:

To explore the various social aspects affecting the well-being of visible minority groups in Canada, including sense of belonging, community integration, personal networks, and loneliness, we have utilized the following datasets:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
We meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to address any irregularities and outliers. This process involved identifying and eliminating null values and duplicate entries present in each dataset. At the initial phase of the project, we developed multiple Tableau sheets, where each sheet focused on a specific dataset feature and addressed a related problem statement.
Subsequently, we combined several sheets based on the correlation between the data, resulting in an interactive and informative dashboard. To enhance user experience and augment the dashboard's functionality, we integrated interactive elements and filters. Upon completion, we published the dashboards on Tableau Public.
